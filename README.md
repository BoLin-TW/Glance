# Project Glance - an e-ink display calendar

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the eCalendar board (V2.1), covering the project's design philosophy, hardware implementation, firmware architecture, and future considerations.

## 1. Design Philosophy

The eCalendar is designed as an ultra-low-power, "glanceable" information appliance. The primary goal is to achieve a battery life of over three months on a single charge by minimizing active time and power consumption.

### Core Principles
-   **Deep Sleep Dominance:** The device spends the vast majority of its time in a deep sleep state to conserve energy.
-   **Daily Update Cycle:** It wakes up once per day to connect to Wi-Fi, download the latest calendar data, and refresh the e-paper display.
-   **Switched Power Rails:** A key feature is the `V33_2` switched power rail, which completely cuts power to peripherals like the external flash and e-paper display during sleep, eliminating quiescent current draw.

### Minimalist Interaction Model
The device is a passive information radiator, not an interactive hub. Calendar management is handled on a user's phone or computer.
-   **Single, Multi-Function Button:** The single user button is for secondary tasks like toggling a "privacy mode" to hide event details or entering a one-time setup mode. It is not for daily navigation.
-   **Exclusion of Additional Sensors:** Features like environmental sensors were intentionally excluded to maintain a focused product scope and avoid unnecessary power consumption.

### Key Components
| Designator | Component          | Value/Type                  | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| U1         | ESP32-S3-wroom     | ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R2       | Main microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.   |
| U14        | MAX17048G+T10      | Fuel Gauge                  | Monitors battery charge level via I2C.           |
| U4         | TPS63031DSKR       | Buck-boost converter        | Main 3.3V power supply for the board.            |
| U12        | TP4057             | Li-Ion Charger              | Manages charging of a single-cell Li-Ion battery.|
| U8         | W25Q128JVSIQ       | Flash Memory                | 128Mbit SPI flash for data storage.              |
| FPC1       | FPC Connector      | 24-pin, 0.5mm pitch         | Connects to an external Waveshare 7.5" 800*480 monocolor e-paper display. |
| USB1       | USB Type-C         | 16-pin                      | For power and data (programming/debugging).      |

### Power Subsystem
-   **Power Input:** USB Type-C or a single-cell Li-Ion battery.
-   **Charging:** The TP4057 (U12) charges the battery from USB power.
-   **Battery Management:** The MAX17048G+T10 (U14) provides accurate battery level monitoring.
-   **Voltage Regulation:** The TPS63031DSKR (U4) buck-boost converter provides a stable 3.3V, forced into Power-Save Mode for high efficiency.
-   **USB-C Compatibility:** CC1/CC2 pins have 5.1kΩ pull-down resistors, ensuring compatibility with all USB-C cables and chargers.

### User Interface
-   **Buttons:** `BOOT` (for flashing), `RST` (for reset), and a single multi-function `BTN` for user interaction (privacy/setup modes).
-   **LEDs:** A white general-purpose `LED` and a red `CHG` indicator for battery charging status. (Note: The white `LED` is active-low, meaning setting its GPIO to 0 turns it on).
